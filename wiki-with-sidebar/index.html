                    Tales of Berseria is a role-playing video game, where 
                    players navigate the game's world through the game's 
                    characters from a third-person perspective. As with 
                    previous Tales games, characters can interact through skits, 
                    animated clips that play outside cutscenes and battle: 
                    characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, 
                    and conversations can range from serious to comedic. 
                    New to the series' Skit systems is a cut-in effect, 
                    where at certain moments within skits characters in various 
                    poses will appear in response to the dialogue.
                </p>
                <h3>Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS)</h3>
                <p>
                    As with previous Tales titles, the game uses a variation of 
                    the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS). Berseria's version 
                    is dubbed the "Liberation-LMBS": when in the battle zone, 
                    players can freely move around the arena and rotate the 
                    camera at will. Characters fight using physical and magical 
                    attacks, along with performing skills known as Artes that 
                    have various effects on enemies such as stunning them or 
                    causing status ailments. Artes can be directly mapped to 
                    different control buttons. Abilities outside attacking 
                    include guarding against attacks, side-stepping around 
                    opponents, and escaping from battle.
                </p>
                <h3>New Battle System</h3>
                <p>
                    A key element in battles is the Soul Gauge, which replaces 
                    the move-governing mechanics of earlier Tales games: each 
                    character has a separate gauge showing up to five Souls, 
                    which are used up when Artes are used. While characters can 
                    still attack with a depleted Soul Gauge, their attacks can 
                    be easily deflected by enemies, but the Soul Gauge 
                    automatically recharges with time. Souls are dropped by 
                    enemies in battle that can be "stolen" to refill the gauge, 
                    a mechanic that enemies can also use to steal Souls from 
                    the player. If enough of the Soul Gauge is full characters 
                    can activate unique states called the Break Soul, where 
                    they can exceed their combo limit and bring unique effects 
                    into battle: for instance, Velvet's Break Soul triggers her 
                    arm to become bestial and different elemental attacks are 
                    triggered depending on enemy type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main party consists of four characters, which can all be 
                    assigned as the controlled character during battle, with the 
                    other available playable characters held in reserve. While 
                    primarily designed for single-player, local multiplayer for 
                    battles is supported. A mechanic called the Switch Blast can 
                    be used when changing characters: by consuming a portion of 
                    the Blast Gauge, the controlled party member switches out 
                    for a reserve member, who delivers a free attack. The Blast 
                    Gauge is also depleted by performing power attacks called 
                    Mystic Artes.

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <h3>Setting</h3>
                <p>
                    Berseria takes places in the Holy Midgand Empire, a powerful 
                    country that rules over this world's archipelago of a 
                    continent. The game's world is shared with Tales of 
                    Zestiria, although the events occur 1000 years before the 
                    latter. There are countless numbers of islands around, and 
                    Midgand's rule crosses even the seas. Areas of land and 
                    islands in the game are divided into "territories." Along 
                    with humans, one of the other main races is the Malakhim 
                    (singular: Malak), supernatural spirits whose wills are 
                    sealed and used by humans as slaves to utilize their magical 
                    abilities after being made visible to even normal humans due 
                    to the Advent, an incident 3 years prior to Velvet's escape 
                    from her prison. Throughout the empire, a disease known as 
                    Daemonblight causes those infected to lose their humanity 
                    and sense of rationality and transform into monsters known 
                    as Daemons, who pose a threat to the world. Along with the 
                    rulers of the Holy Midgand Empire exists a theocratic order 
                    known as the Abbey, who are of great political and religious 
                    importance and are influential in imperial affairs. The 
                    Exorcists, soldiers from the Abbey, are tasked with bringing 
                    peace and order by purging the world of Daemons and are 
                    willing to go to extremes to reach their goal.
                </p>
                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    When she was a child, Velvet Crowe and her younger brother 
                    Laphicet were saved by her brother-in-law Artorius when a 
                    Scarlet Night happened and daemons attacked their village; 
                    Velvet's pregnant older sister Celica was killed during the 
                    event known as the "Opening". Seven years later, Velvet 
                    takes care of her sickly brother with Artorius. The Scarlet 
                    Night returns, with the entire village succumbing to the 
                    Daemonblight: when Velvet finds Artorius, she sees him 
                    sacrifice her brother as part of a ritual, known as the 
                    "Advent". Artorius attempts to use her for the Advent as 
                    well, but she fights back and the Daemonblight possesses her 
                    arm, mutating it and turning her into a Daemon called a 
                    "Therion", with the ability to absorb Daemons. In a rage, 
                    she slaughters the nearby Daemons before passing out. She 
                    awakes in a prison for Daemons on the island Titania, 
                    swearing to kill Artorius and avenge her brother's murder. A 
                    group of beings known as Malakhim, who were previously only 
                    visible to "resonant" individuals, become visible to most 
                    people of the world after the "Advent". Over the next three 
                    years, Artorius forms the Abbey to bring peace to the Holy 
                    Midgand Empire, becoming the Abbey's "Shepherd" and is seen 
                    as a savior by the people for establishing the Exorcists 
                    using the malakhim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After three years in prison, Velvet is freed by Seres, 
                    Artorius' former malak, who has broken away from him. During 
                    her escape, Velvet aids fellow prisoners Rokurou and Magilou 
                    and fights against the Praetor Exorcist Oscar Dragonia. 
                    Seres takes a fatal attack when Oscar turns one of his 
                    Malakhim servants into a dragon to face them. Absorbing 
                    Seres at her own request, Velvet makes a final attack on 
                    Oscar that blinds him in one eye before he escapes. Velvet 
                    realizes at this point that Seres must be a reincarnation of 
                    her deceased sister, Celica. Velvet and company then escape 
                    the island. Over the course of her journey to get her 
                    revenge, she also meets Laphicet, a Malak formerly in 
                    service to Praetor Exorcist Teresa Linares until being 
                    kidnapped and named by her; Eleanor, an Abbey Exorcist who 
                    questions their methods; and Eizen, a Malak who travels with 
                    pirates who grant the group sanctuary. They are also joined 
                    by Bienfu, a Normin Malak originally contracted with Magilou 
                    and who had since been bound to Eleanor while Magilou was 
                    imprisoned. Eleanor is initially reluctant to join Velvet, 
                    attempting suicide before being asked to spy on the group 
                    and then learning the Abbey's full plans.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                The scenario was written by Naoki Yamamoto, who had previously 
                worked on Zestiria. Despite being a distant prequel to Tales of 
                Zestiria—taking place in the distant past and containing 
                references—the game's story was designed to be able to work on 
                its own. This distant connection concept was inspired by the 
                developer's wish to emulate the similar distant narrative 
                connection between Tales of Phantasia and Tales of Symphonia. It 
                also featured nods to earlier entries in the series, such as the 
                party's ship being named after a similar transport ship in Tales 
                of Eternia. The main theme of Tales of Berseria is the conflict 
                between emotion and reason, with Velvet being the incarnation of 
                emotion and rage. This theme is represented in the game's title, 
                which stems from the term "Berserker", legendary warriors who 
                were imbued with uncontrollable power.

                    The Great Twilight has begun, the awful curse spreads 
                    throughout the Erebonian Empire. As the power of the Ashen 
                    Chevalier, Rean Schwarzer, becomes uncontrollable, his real 
                    self-starts to fade. While the world heads for its demise, 
                    what can the remaining members of the Original and New Class 
                    VII do to save their friend and their world?

                    Languishing in chains as dusk falls around him.
                    A guiding light swallowed by the darkness, in an empire 
                    shrouded by its curse. Filled with regrets that will never 
                    cease. Plagued by questions that will go unanswered. Unable 
                    to protect that which he held dear, lost in despair over 
                    mistakes that cannot be undone, he listlessly awaits his 
                    fate as a <b>"Sacrifice."</b> This is what has become of 
                    <b>Rean Schwarzer</b>, the <b>Ashen Chevalier</b>. As he 
                    sits in darkness, the world edges ever closer to its demise. 
                    The Erebonian Empire, the country with the most powerful 
                    military in recorded history, is now poised to swallow up 
                    the entire continent under the banner of its largest 
                    invasion plan yetâ€”Operation Jormungandr. In response, the 
                    rest of the world rallies together in a last-ditch effort 
                    to fell this mighty serpent, no matter the cost.

                    The heroes of <b>Class VII</b> find themselves against the 
                    full force of the Empire in an attempt to stop its path of 
                    total domination. Now, the students of <b>Class VII</b>, 
                    old and new, must unite with heroes from all over the 
                    continent to create the only chance the world has to be 
                    spared from total destruction. The heroes of <b>Class VII
                    </b> unite with Crossbell's <b><i>Special Support Section
                    </i></b> and even the heroes of <b><i>Liberl</i></b>.

                    All members of <b>Class VII</b> prepare themselves for their final 
                    mission. Many trials await them: confrontations with 
                    familiar faces, new faces but also farewells to remnants 
                    and relics of the past.
